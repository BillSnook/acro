# acro

This project is intended to satisfy the criteria for a programming assessment for a position at Macy's.

I use Cocoapods for this project so someone intending to build this app needs to do the standard Cocoapods setup.

For the record, setting up Cocoapods is as follows:

  In Terminal, enter the following lines:

sudo gem install cocoapods

pod setup

  Then go to the directory with the acro.xcworkspace file and enter:

pods install

  Then build and run the app.
